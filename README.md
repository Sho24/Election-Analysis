## Challeges Overview
- The challenge were:
  - Looping to list and dictionary is very challenging as geting key and its value using loop is some time confuzing as lots of key concepts and you can loop in different way such as using range(), for in , using len() 
  - Indenting code is diffecult as if you do not follow right way then you do not get expected out put and should be align to proper indent
  - formatting is not so diffecuylt but its different then usual programming , also print f and concatination of string is not same like other programming language
  - writing output ti text file and using import csv,io module which is wider and has lots of sub-desciption (Function,variable,method) which hard to remember have to pratice lots in order to get grip on it
  - Reading .csv and storing values in List / dictionary
  -    
## Challeges Overview
   Need more attention and more practise to improve, its has lots of challenges and you only get success if you put your 100% efferts
